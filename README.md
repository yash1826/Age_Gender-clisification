# Age and Gender Classification using CNN and UTKFace Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting age and gender from facial images. We leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their effectiveness in image processing tasks. The UTKFace dataset, which contains a large variety of facial images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity, is used to train and evaluate the model.

## Features

- **Accurate Age Prediction:** Predicts the age of a person from their facial image.
- **Gender Classification:** Classifies the gender of a person as male or female.
- **Robust CNN Model:** Utilizes a deep CNN architecture for high accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Uses the UTKFace dataset which includes images of diverse age groups, genders, and ethnicities.

## Dataset

### UTKFace Dataset

The UTKFace dataset contains over 20,000 facial images with labels for age, gender, and ethnicity. The dataset spans a wide range of ages from 0 to 116 years and includes images from various ethnic backgrounds. Each image is a 200x200 pixel RGB image.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, dropout layers for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification. The architecture is designed to extract meaningful features from facial images and make accurate predictions for age and gender.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/age-gender-classification.git
   cd age-gender-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the UTKFace dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model on the test set, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### Making Predictions

To make predictions on new images, use:
```bash
python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results

The model achieves competitive accuracy on the UTKFace dataset. Detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, can be found in the results section of the documentation.
